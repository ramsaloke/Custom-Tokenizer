# Custom Tokenizer

Hey! I made this simple web app that converts text into numbers and back.

## What it does:
- You type some text (like "Hello World")
- It converts each character to a unique number
- You can convert those numbers back to the original text
- Shows you the mapping between characters and numbers

## How to use:
1. Type text in the box
2. Click "Tokenize" to get numbers
3. Click "Detokenize" to get your text back
4. Use "Clear All" to start over

## Example:
"Hi" becomes [1, 2] where:
- H = 1
- i = 2

## Why I made it:
Learning how tokenizers work! It's like having a secret code where each letter gets a number.

## Tech stuff:
- React
- Simple character-level tokenization
- No fancy libraries, just basic JavaScript

Try it out! Type something and see the magic happen. ��
